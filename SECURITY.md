# Security Policy

Security vulnerabilities should be [disclosed](#reporting-a-vulnerability) by email to security@openzeppelin.com.

To make your support policy require less maintenance, you can simplify the table and description by automatically tying support to the most recent major version. Here’s a revised version:

---

## Supported Versions

Only the latest **major** version is supported and receives security updates. Alpha, Beta, and Release Candidate versions are not supported.

Security patches are released for the latest minor and patch version of the current major release.

Only critical severity bug fixes may be backported to earlier major versions.

| Version      | Supported |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Latest major | ✅         |
| Older majors | ❌         |
