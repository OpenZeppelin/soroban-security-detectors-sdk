      title: Function Using Temporary Storage Value as Condition Detected
      opening: Using a temporary storage value as a condition in a function can lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities. Temporary storage values should not be used in conditions as they can disappear unexpectedly, potentially causing logic errors or security issues.
      body-single-file-single-instance: In `$file_name`, the function `$FUNCTION_NAME` uses a temporary storage value as a condition.
      body-single-file-multiple-instance: In `$file_name`, multiple functions use temporary storage values as conditions.
      body-multiple-file-multiple-instance: Across $total_files files, multiple functions use temporary storage values as conditions.
      body-list-item-intro: 'The following functions were found using temporary storage values as conditions:'
      body-list-item-single-file: '- Function `$FUNCTION_NAME` in [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      body-list-item-multiple-file: '- Function `$FUNCTION_NAME` in [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      closing: To ensure proper functionality and usability, avoid using temporary storage values as conditions in functions. Review the identified functions and refactor them to use stable and reliable conditions instead.
