      title: Contract With MAX TTL Extension Detected
      opening: Smart contracts should extend `TTL` with a `max_ttl` value, which should be calculated instead of being used as is. Contracts that do not follow this practice may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
      body-single-file-single-instance: In `$file_name`, the contract `$CONTRACT_NAME` extends `TTL` with a `max_ttl` value.
      body-single-file-multiple-instance: In `$file_name`, multiple contracts extend `TTL` with a `max_ttl` value.
      body-multiple-file-multiple-instance: Across $total_files files, multiple contracts extend `TTL` with a `max_ttl` value.
      body-list-item-intro: 'The following contracts were found extending `TTL` with a `max_ttl` value:'
      body-list-item-single-file: '- Contract `$CONTRACT_NAME` in [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      body-list-item-multiple-file: '- Contract `$CONTRACT_NAME` in [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      closing: To ensure proper functionality and usability, extend `TTL` with a calculated `max_ttl` value. Review the identified contracts and adjust the `max_ttl` implementation as required.
