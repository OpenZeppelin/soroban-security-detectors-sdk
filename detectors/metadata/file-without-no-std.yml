      title: Missing `#![no_std]` Attribute
      opening: Files intended for environments without a standard library should include the `#![no_std]` attribute. Omitting this attribute may lead to compatibility issues or unintended dependencies on the standard library.
      body-single-file-single-instance: In `$file_name`, the `#![no_std]` attribute is missing, which may cause compatibility issues in environments without a standard library.
      body-single-file-multiple-instance: In `$file_name`, multiple instances indicate the absence of the `#![no_std]` attribute, which may lead to compatibility issues.
      body-multiple-file-multiple-instance: Across $total_files files, the `#![no_std]` attribute is missing, potentially causing compatibility issues in environments without a standard library.
      body-list-item-intro: 'The following files are missing the `#![no_std]` attribute:'
      body-list-item-single-file: '- [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      body-list-item-multiple-file: '- [`$file_name`]($instance_line_link)'
      closing: To ensure compatibility with environments lacking a standard library, include the `#![no_std]` attribute in the file. This helps avoid unintended dependencies and ensures proper functionality in constrained environments.
